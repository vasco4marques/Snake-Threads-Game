# SNAKES THREAD GAME

This game was built by me for the PCD subject in my software engineer course at ISCTE <br>
PCD stands for "Programação Concorrente e Distribuída" and it teaches us about threads, concurrency and server management <br>



## To Run

All you need is to import the code and run the main file <br>
To start the Server -> Client interaction you just need to start each client since the server runs automatically <br>
